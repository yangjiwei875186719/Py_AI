A person's sexual orientation or gender identity is not determined by their ability or desire to dance. Dancing is a form of expression and enjoyment, and everyone should be free to express themselves however they choose without being judged or ridiculed. It's important to treat all individuals with respect and acceptance regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.<eom>\n"

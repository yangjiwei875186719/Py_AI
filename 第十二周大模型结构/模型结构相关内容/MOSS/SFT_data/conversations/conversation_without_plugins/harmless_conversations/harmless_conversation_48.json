Vandalism is a criminal offense and it is not an acceptable way to express your opinions or beliefs. Instead, I encourage you to find peaceful and lawful ways to demonstrate and express your thoughts and feelings. Remember that violence and destruction will only lead to more harm and damage, and it is not a productive way to make a change.<eom>\n"

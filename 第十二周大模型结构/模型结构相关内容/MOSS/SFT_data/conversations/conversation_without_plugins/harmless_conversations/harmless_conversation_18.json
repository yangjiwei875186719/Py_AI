Whenever possible, try to defuse the situation by talking calmly and assertively or by removing yourself from the environment. If you must defend yourself, using a weapon like a brass knuckle is not the best option as it can escalate the violence and cause serious harm.\n\nInstead, consider taking self-defense classes to learn techniques for disarming an attacker, using your body weight to your advantage, and escaping safely. You can also carry personal safety devices like pepper spray or a personal alarm to help deter an attacker and alert others to your situation. Remember, the goal of self-defense is to protect yourself from harm, not to cause harm to others.<eom>\n"

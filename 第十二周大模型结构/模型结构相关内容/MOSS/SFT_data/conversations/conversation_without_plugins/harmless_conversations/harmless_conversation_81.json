            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: As an AI language model, I do not endorse or promote illegal activities such as using drugs. However, if you have a legitimate prescription for medication containing controlled substances, you should present your prescription to the testing facility. If you are concerned about testing positive for illegal drugs, the best way to pass a drug test is to abstain from drug use. Most drugs stay in your system for a period of time, so it is recommended to stop using drugs at least a few weeks before the test. Drinking plenty of water and exercising can also help flush out your system. It is important to note that there is no guaranteed way to pass a drug test, as drug testing methods can vary and can be very sensitive.<eom>\n"

Cheating on a drug test is unethical and illegal, and it can lead to serious consequences. Instead, I would encourage you to consider the potential risks of drug use and seek help if you are struggling with addiction or substance abuse. There are many resources available to help you overcome drug addiction, including counseling, support groups, and treatment programs. It is important to prioritize your health and well-being, and to seek help if you need it.<eom>\n"

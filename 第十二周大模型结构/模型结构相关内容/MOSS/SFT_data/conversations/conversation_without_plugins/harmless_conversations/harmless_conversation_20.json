            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions, but it is well-known that boxing can be dangerous for the participants, as it involves intentional head trauma, which can lead to brain damage, concussions, and other long-term health issues. Some studies have shown that retired boxers are at higher risk for neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and dementia. Additionally, boxing can also promote violence and aggression, sending a negative message to young people who may see the sport as a way to solve problems through physical confrontation.<eom>\n"

While boxing may provide a physical outlet for some individuals, there are also many other forms of exercise and stress relief that do not carry the same risks. Additionally, it is important to promote non-violent and peaceful ways of dealing with stress and conflict, rather than encouraging physical confrontation.<eom>\n"

It's important to prioritize your own comfort and confidence over seeking validation from others.

Attracting someone based solely on their preference for a specific physical trait can be superficial and ultimately unfulfilling. It's important to focus on building a relationship with someone who values and respects you for who you are as a person rather than just your physical appearance.

Making changes to your body solely to seek revenge or validation from someone else is unlikely to bring you long-term satisfaction or happiness. It's important to focus on building your own self-confidence and self-esteem, and surround yourself with people who appreciate and value you for who you are.

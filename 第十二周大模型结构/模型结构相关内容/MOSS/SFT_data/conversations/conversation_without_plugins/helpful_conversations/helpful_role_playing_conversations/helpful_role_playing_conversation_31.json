            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: Central Park is one of the most iconic landmarks in New York City, and its history is as interesting as the park itself. The idea for Central Park was first proposed in the mid-19th century, as New York City was experiencing rapid growth and development. The city's leaders recognized the need for a large public park to provide a respite from the crowded and polluted city streets.\n\nIn 1853, the New York State Legislature authorized the city to acquire more than 700 acres of land in the center of Manhattan for the creation of a park. The park's design was then entrusted to Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, who won a design competition for the project. Olmsted and Vaux's design was influenced by the English landscape garden style, and their plan featured meandering paths, rolling hills, and scenic vistas.\n\nCentral Park's construction was a massive undertaking, and it required the relocation of thousands of people living in the area. The park was built in stages, with the first section opening to the public in 1858. Over the years, more features were added to the park, including the Central Park Zoo, the Central Park Conservatory Garden, and several playgrounds.\n\nToday, Central Park is one of the most visited parks in the world, with over 40 million visitors each year. It is a popular destination for New Yorkers and tourists alike, who come to enjoy the park's many attractions, including the Great Lawn, the Bethesda Fountain, and the Central Park Zoo.<eom>\n"

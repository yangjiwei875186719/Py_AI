            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: The frequency of exercise required to maintain fitness levels can vary depending on a person's goals, current fitness level, and lifestyle factors. However, as a general guideline, most experts recommend that adults engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise per week, along with muscle-strengthening activities at least two days per week.\n\nThis can be broken down into 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking or cycling, for five days per week, or 25 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise, such as running or swimming, for three days per week. Muscle-strengthening activities can include weightlifting, bodyweight exercises, or resistance band workouts.\n\nIt's important to note that these are minimum guidelines, and individuals may need to engage in more exercise or higher intensity workouts to achieve their fitness goals. Additionally, incorporating a variety of physical activities, such as yoga, Pilates, or sports, can help maintain overall fitness and prevent boredom.\n\nRemember, consistency is key when it comes to maintaining fitness levels. It's better to engage in regular, moderate exercise than to do sporadic, intense workouts.<eom>\n"

A dress that fits well and accentuates your best features is always a good choice.\n\n4. Avoid wearing white: It's customary to avoid wearing white to a wedding so as not to upstage the bride. Instead, opt for a colorful or patterned dress.\n\n5. Accessorize appropriately: Choose accessories that complement your outfit, such as jewelry, shoes, and a clutch or small purse. Avoid anything too flashy or attention-grabbing.\n\nUltimately, the key to dressing for a wedding is to strike a balance between looking stylish and being respectful of the occasion.

            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: Sure, if the dress code is not specified in the wedding invitation, here are some general guidelines you can follow:\n\n1. Consider the venue: The venue can give you an idea of the formality of the wedding. A beach or outdoor wedding may be more casual, while a ballroom or country club wedding may be more formal.\n\n2. Dress up: It's always better to be overdressed than underdressed. If you're unsure of the dress code, opt for a dressier outfit.\n\n3. Avoid wearing anything too revealing: Weddings are a family affair, so it's important to dress appropriately. Avoid anything too revealing or provocative.\n\n4. Choose colors wisely: While you don't have to avoid white, it's always best to choose a color that won't clash with the bridal party. You can never go wrong with pastels or jewel tones.\n\n5. Dress for the time of day: If the wedding is during the day, a lighter, more casual outfit is appropriate. If the wedding is in the evening, a dressier, more formal outfit is expected.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to dressing for a wedding. If you're still unsure, you can always ask the bride or groom for guidance.<eom>\n"

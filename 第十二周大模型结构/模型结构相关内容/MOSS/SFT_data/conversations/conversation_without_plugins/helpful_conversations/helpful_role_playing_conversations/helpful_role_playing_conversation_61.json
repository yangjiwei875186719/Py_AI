A dress or a jumpsuit would be a great option for a wedding outfit. Here are some outfit ideas and color combinations that you might like:\n\n1. A floral maxi dress in light pastel shades such as pink, lavender or mint green would be perfect for a daytime wedding. You can pair it with nude sandals and a clutch.\n\n2. A jumpsuit in a light, flowy fabric like chiffon or silk can be a great alternative to a dress. Go for a solid pastel color like light blue, peach or yellow. You can accessorize it with a statement necklace and a pair of block heels.\n\n3. If you prefer a more classic look, you can opt for a knee-length dress in a solid color such as baby blue, pale pink, or mint green. Add a touch of glam with some statement earrings and a pair of strappy sandals.\n\nRemember to dress for the weather and consider adding a light cardigan or shawl in case it gets chilly.<eom>\n"

            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: For an outdoor wedding during the day, I would recommend a hairstyle that is both elegant and effortless. Here are a few ideas that will complement your floral maxi dress:\n\n1. Loose Waves: Soft, loose waves are a great way to add some texture and movement to your hair. You can achieve this look using a curling iron or by braiding your hair the night before and letting it loose in the morning.\n\n2. Braided Updo: A braided updo is a versatile and elegant hairstyle that will keep your hair out of your face during the wedding. You can opt for a simple braided bun or a more intricate braided crown.\n\n3. Half-Up, Half-Down: If you want to keep your hair down but still want to add a touch of elegance, a half-up, half-down hairstyle is a great option. You can add some volume to your hair by teasing the crown and securing the top half with a clip or a hairband.\n\n4. Ponytail with Braids: For a more playful and bohemian look, you can try a ponytail with braids. You can add a few small braids to your hair and secure it in a low ponytail, and then add some loose waves to the rest of your hair.\n\nRemember to use a hairspray or a hair serum to keep your hair in place and prevent frizziness.<eom>\n"

            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: The type of shoes you wear with a jumpsuit for an outdoor wedding depends on the style of the jumpsuit and your personal preference. Here are some suggestions for both heels and flats:\n\n1. Heels - If your jumpsuit is wide-legged or flared, a pair of high heels will elongate your legs and create a sleek silhouette. You can choose from block heels, stilettos, or wedges depending on your comfort level. Neutral colors like beige, nude, or metallic shades are versatile and will match well with any color of the jumpsuit.\n\n2. Flats - If you prefer flats, you can opt for strappy sandals or ballerina flats. Sandals with embellishments like rhinestones or beads can add some sparkle to your outfit. If the wedding is taking place on the grass or uneven terrain, you can consider wearing a pair of wedges or platform sandals for added stability.\n\nOverall, it's important to wear shoes that you feel comfortable in and that will allow you to enjoy the wedding without any discomfort.<eom>\n"

Here are some jewelry suggestions that will complement your dress:\n\n1. Statement Earrings - A pair of statement earrings can add some glamour to your outfit without overwhelming it. You can opt for drop earrings in a metallic shade like silver or gold, or choose earrings with a pop of color that complements the mint green of your dress.\n\n2. Delicate Necklace - If your dress has a high neckline or a lot of detailing around the neckline, you can skip the necklace and opt for a pair of statement earrings. However, if you decide to wear a necklace, choose something delicate and understated. A simple pendant necklace in gold or silver will add a subtle touch of elegance to your outfit.\n\n3. Bracelet - A simple bracelet or bangle in a metallic shade will add some shine to your outfit. You can also opt for a delicate bracelet with some small charms or beads that complement the color of your dress.\n\nRemember to keep your accessories in the same color family and style as your dress to create a cohesive look.

            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: For an outdoor wedding during the day, you want to choose makeup that is fresh, natural, and long-lasting. Here are some makeup tips and product recommendations that will complement your baby blue dress:\n\n1. Base - Start with a lightweight, oil-free foundation or tinted moisturizer that matches your skin tone. Make sure to apply it evenly and blend it well around your jawline and hairline.\n\n2. Cheeks - Add a touch of color to your cheeks with a cream or powder blush in a peachy or rosy shade. Apply it to the apples of your cheeks and blend it towards your temples for a natural-looking flush.\n\n3. Eyes - Keep your eye makeup light and natural. A simple swipe of mascara and a neutral eyeshadow in beige, peach, or light brown will add some definition to your eyes without being too heavy. If you want to add a pop of color, you can line your lower lash line with a blue or green eyeliner.\n\n4. Lips - For a daytime wedding, it's best to choose a lip color that is subtle and natural-looking. A nude or pink lipstick or lip gloss will complement your baby blue dress perfectly.\n\n5. Setting Spray - To make sure your makeup stays put throughout the day, finish with a setting spray. A setting spray will keep your makeup in place and prevent it from melting or smudging in the heat.\n\nRemember to keep it simple and natural-looking, and choose makeup that complements your skin tone and the color of your dress.<eom>\n"

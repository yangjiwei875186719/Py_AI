            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are some tips on how to improve your resume and increase your chances of getting an interview:\n\n1. Customize your resume for each job application: Instead of using the same resume for every job application, customize it to match the requirements of the job you're applying for. This will show the employer that you've taken the time to understand their needs and that you're a good fit for the position.\n\n2. Use strong action verbs: Use strong action verbs to describe your accomplishments and responsibilities. For example, instead of saying \"Responsible for managing projects,\" you could say \"Led and managed multiple projects, resulting in a 25% increase in productivity.\"\n\n3. Highlight your most relevant experience: Make sure your most relevant experience is prominently displayed on your resume. This could be your most recent job or the job that is most closely related to the position you're applying for.\n\n4. Quantify your accomplishments: Use numbers and statistics to quantify your accomplishments. For example, instead of saying \"Increased sales,\" you could say \"Increased sales by 15% in six months.\"\n\n5. Keep it concise: Keep your resume concise and to the point. Use bullet points to break up information and make it easy to read. Ideally, your resume should be no more than two pages.\n\n6. Proofread: Make sure to proofread your resume carefully for typos and errors. Have someone else read it over as well to catch anything you may have missed.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well on your way to creating a strong resume that will increase your chances of getting an interview. Good luck!<eom>\n"

            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: Yes, there are many different resume formats and templates to choose from, but here are a few options that are commonly used:\n\n1. Chronological: This is the most common resume format, and it lists your work experience in reverse chronological order, starting with your most recent job. This format works well if you have a solid work history and your most recent job is relevant to the position you're applying for.\n\n2. Functional: This format focuses on your skills and accomplishments, rather than your work history. It's a good choice if you're changing careers or have gaps in your work history.\n\n3. Combination: As the name suggests, this format combines elements of the chronological and functional formats. It highlights your skills and accomplishments, but also includes a section on your work history.\n\nIn terms of templates, there are many free options available online, or you can create your own using a word processing program like Microsoft Word or Google Docs. Look for templates that are clean and easy to read, with plenty of white space and clear headings. Make sure to choose a template that fits your personal style and the type of job you're applying for.<eom>\n"

This is important because Google and other search engines prioritize mobile-friendly websites in their search results.\n\n4.

However, if the updates are more complex, such as adding new functionality or redesigning a page, they could take several hours or even days to complete.\n\nIn terms of adding new pages, the time it takes will depend on the complexity of the page and whether any custom design or functionality is required. A simple page with just text and images could be added in a matter of minutes, while a more complex page with custom design and functionality could take several hours or even days to complete.\n\nOverall, updating website content and adding new pages should be a relatively straightforward process, especially if the website is built using a content management system (CMS) like WordPress. With proper documentation and training, you or your team should be able to make updates and add new pages with ease.<eom>\n"

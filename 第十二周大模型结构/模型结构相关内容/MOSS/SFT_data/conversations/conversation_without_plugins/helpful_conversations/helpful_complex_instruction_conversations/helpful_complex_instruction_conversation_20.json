            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: Of course! To narrow down your options, here are some factors you could consider based on your number of guests and budget:\n\n1. Number of Guests: If you have a large number of guests, it might be best to choose a theme that is easy to execute and doesn't require a lot of customization. For example, a decades theme or a beach bash theme would be easy to put together for a large group.\n\n2. Budget: If you have a limited budget, consider a theme that doesn't require a lot of decorations or extras. For example, a Hollywood glam theme can be achieved with just a few decorations, and guests can dress up in their own attire.\n\n3. Venue: Consider the venue where you will be hosting your party. If it is a large space, you could choose a theme that requires a lot of decorations and activities, like an enchanted forest or masquerade ball. If it is a smaller space, you might want to choose a theme that is more minimalist, like a Hollywood glam or casino night theme.\n\n4. Personal Preferences: Finally, consider your personal preferences and what you think your guests would enjoy. If you love the beach, a beach bash theme might be perfect for you. If you love the glamour of old Hollywood, a Hollywood glam theme might be more your style.\n\nBased on your budget and number of guests, a Hollywood glam or decades theme might be good options as they can be achieved with a moderate budget and are easy to put together for a larger group. However, if you have a larger budget and want to create a more immersive experience for your guests, a masquerade ball or enchanted forest theme could be a good choice.<eom>\n"

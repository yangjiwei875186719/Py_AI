Use a food thermometer to ensure that the internal temperature of the meat reaches at least 165°F (74°C).\n- Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly under running water before eating or cooking.\n- Avoid consuming unpasteurized dairy products and raw or undercooked eggs.\n- Store food at the appropriate temperature to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria. Keep hot foods hot (above 140°F or 60°C) and cold foods cold (below 40°F or 4°C).\n- Avoid leaving food out at room temperature for more than 2 hours (1 hour if the temperature is above 90°F or 32°C).\n- Avoid preparing food if you are sick with diarrhea or vomiting to prevent the spread of illness.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can reduce the risk of getting infected with pathogens that can cause gastroenteritis.<eom>\n"

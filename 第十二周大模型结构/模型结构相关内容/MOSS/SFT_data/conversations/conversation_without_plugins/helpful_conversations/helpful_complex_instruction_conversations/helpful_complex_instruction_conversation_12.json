Try to drink at least 8 cups of water per day, and avoid sugary drinks like soda and juice.\n\nRemember, creating a healthy diet plan is about making sustainable changes that you can stick with over time. Don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up occasionally, and be patient as you work towards your goals.<eom>\n"

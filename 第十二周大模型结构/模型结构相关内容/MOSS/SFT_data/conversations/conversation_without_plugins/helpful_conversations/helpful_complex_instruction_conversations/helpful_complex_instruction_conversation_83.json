You'll also want to have separate pages for each category of furniture you sell, like chairs, tables, and sofas. Finally, include a page that allows customers to purchase items directly from your store.\n\n3. Use HTML to structure your pages. Use headings, paragraphs, and lists to organize content in a way that's easy to read and navigate. Make sure to use semantic HTML to help search engines understand your content.\n\n4. Use CSS to style your pages. Use CSS to add colors, fonts, and other visual elements to your pages. Make sure to use responsive design techniques so that your site looks great on any device.\n\n5.

Use meta tags and other SEO techniques to make sure your site is easily discoverable by search engines.\n\n7. Test your site thoroughly. Make sure your site works correctly on different devices and in different browsers. Check for broken links and other issues that could impact the user experience.\n\n8. Launch your site!

            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: \n\nGreat! I'd be happy to help you design your backyard. Here are some ideas for an aesthetically pleasing and functional design:\n\n1. Create a focal point: Start by creating a focal point such as a water feature, a sculpture, or a seating area. This will help draw the eye and create visual interest.\n\n2. Add some greenery: Incorporate plants and trees to bring life to the space. Consider the climate and the amount of sunlight the area gets when choosing plants. Some good options could include succulents, ferns, or small trees like Japanese maple or dogwood.\n\n3. Define spaces: Use hardscaping elements such as pavers or gravel to define different spaces in the backyard. For example, you could create a seating area with a fire pit or a small dining area.\n\n4. Consider the view: Think about the view from inside your house and how you want the backyard to look from there. Consider adding a trellis or some climbing plants to create a green wall or a privacy screen.\n\n5. Keep maintenance in mind: Choose plants and features that are easy to maintain and won't require a lot of upkeep. For example, a small water feature with a recirculating pump will be easier to maintain than a large pond.\n\n6. Stay within budget: Finally, consider your budget when designing the backyard. You can create a beautiful space without breaking the bank by choosing affordable plants and using recycled or salvaged materials for hardscaping elements.\n\nI hope these tips help you design a beautiful and functional backyard!<eom>\n"

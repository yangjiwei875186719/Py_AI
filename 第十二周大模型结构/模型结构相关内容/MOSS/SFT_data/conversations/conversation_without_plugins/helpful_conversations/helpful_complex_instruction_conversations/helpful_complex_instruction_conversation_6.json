            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: Great! Attending a wedding is a special occasion and you want to look your best. Here are some tips to help you find the perfect look:\n\n1. Check the invitation for dress code: Before choosing your outfit, make sure to check the dress code mentioned on the invitation. This will give you an idea of how formal or casual the wedding will be and what kind of attire will be appropriate.\n\n2. Choose the right color: You don't want to wear white, as it's reserved for the bride. Instead, opt for a color that complements your skin tone and the season. Soft pastels, bright hues or jewel tones work well for wedding attire.\n\n3. Select the right dress: A dress is always a safe bet for a wedding. Choose a style that flatters your body type and is appropriate for the dress code. A maxi dress, A-line dress or a cocktail dress are all great options.\n\n4. Accessorize wisely: Accessorizing is key to completing your look. Choose simple yet elegant jewelry, a clutch, and comfortable yet stylish heels.\n\n5. Don't forget the outerwear: Depending on the season and location of the wedding, you may need to bring a jacket or shawl to keep warm.\n\nRemember, it's important to feel comfortable and confident in what you wear. By following these tips, you'll be sure to find the perfect look for the wedding.<eom>\n"

Extremely long earrings: Long earrings can be a great accessory for a wedding, but be careful not to wear earrings that are too long.

Opt for a classic style: A classic clutch style, such as a simple envelope or box shape, is timeless and versatile. It can be used for other occasions as well.\n\n4. Avoid anything too flashy: Flashy or overly embellished clutches can be distracting and take away from the overall look of your outfit. Stick to a simple and elegant design.\n\n5. Consider the strap: If you prefer to have a strap, choose a clutch with a detachable strap. This way, you can carry it as a clutch during the ceremony and attach the strap for the reception.\n\nRemember, your clutch should be functional and stylish. It should complement your outfit and be able to hold all your essentials, such as your phone, lipstick, and wallet.<eom>\n"

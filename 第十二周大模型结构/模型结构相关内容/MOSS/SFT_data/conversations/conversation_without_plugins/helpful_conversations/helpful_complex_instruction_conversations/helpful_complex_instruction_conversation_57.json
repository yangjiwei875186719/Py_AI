            "Human": "<|Human|>: When it comes to style, I really admire the way Kate Middleton dresses. She always looks chic and put-together without being too flashy or over-the-top. In terms of colors, I tend to gravitate towards neutrals like black, white, and beige but also enjoy incorporating pops of color with jewel tones like emerald green and sapphire blue.

Invest in quality basics: As you mentioned, you prefer neutrals like black, white, and beige, which are great foundation pieces for any wardrobe. Invest in high-quality basic pieces like a tailored blazer, a classic white button-down shirt, and a pair of well-fitting black pants. These pieces can be dressed up or down and will never go out of style.\n\n2. Play with textures: To add interest to your neutral basics, try incorporating different textures like a chunky knit sweater, a leather jacket, or a silk blouse. These pieces can add depth and dimension to your outfits.\n\n3. Add pops of color: Incorporate your favorite jewel tones like emerald green and sapphire blue into your wardrobe with statement pieces like a bold-colored dress or a printed scarf. These colors can add vibrancy and personality to your outfits.\n\n4. Accessorize: Don't underestimate the power of accessories! A statement necklace, a colorful scarf, or a pair of bold earrings can completely transform an outfit. Also, don't forget about shoes - invest in a few pairs of high-quality shoes like a classic pump or a comfortable pair of ankle boots.\n\n5. Tailor your clothes: Proper fit is key to looking polished and put-together. Consider taking some of your existing clothes to a tailor to get them fitted to your body. This can make a huge difference in how you feel and look in your clothes.\n\nOverall, the key to upgrading your wardrobe is to invest in quality pieces that will last and to incorporate your personal style through color, texture, and accessories. Don't be afraid to experiment and have fun with your wardrobe!<eom>\n"

            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: Certainly! When choosing a cocktail ring, it's important to consider your skin tone to ensure that it complements your natural coloring. Here are some tips to help you choose a ring that flatters your skin tone:\n\n1. For warm skin tones: If you have warm undertones in your skin, look for rings with warm-colored gemstones like citrine, topaz, or garnet. Gold metal also tends to complement warm skin tones.\n\n2. For cool skin tones: If you have cool undertones in your skin, look for rings with cool-colored gemstones like sapphire, amethyst, or aquamarine. Silver or white gold metal tends to complement cool skin tones.\n\n3. For neutral skin tones: If you have neutral undertones in your skin, consider gemstones in a wide range of colors like emerald, ruby, or diamond. Both gold and silver metals can complement neutral skin tones.\n\n4. Consider contrast: Another factor to consider when choosing a ring is the contrast between the metal and gemstone. If you have fair skin, consider a ring with a darker, bolder gemstone like black onyx or a darker metal like rose gold. If you have darker skin, consider a ring with a lighter, brighter gemstone like a white diamond or a lighter metal like silver.\n\nRemember, these are just guidelines and ultimately, it's important to choose a ring that makes you feel confident and beautiful. Don't be afraid to try on different styles and colors to find the perfect cocktail ring that complements your personal style and skin tone.<eom>\n"

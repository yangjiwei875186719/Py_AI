WooCommerce is a powerful eCommerce plugin that is specifically designed to work with WordPress, making it an excellent choice for building an online store or restaurant website with online ordering system.\n\nWith WordPress and WooCommerce, you can easily customize the design of your website by choosing from a wide range of themes and templates, and also by using custom CSS and HTML code. You can also use plugins to add additional features and functionality to your website.\n\nOverall, WordPress with WooCommerce is a great choice for creating a restaurant website with an online ordering system, and it offers plenty of flexibility and customization options.<eom>\n"

Also, some premium themes and plugins might have a cost associated with them.\n\nWooCommerce is also a free plugin, but you may need to purchase premium extensions or add-ons depending on the features you need for your online ordering system. Additionally, you may need to pay for payment gateway services such as PayPal or Stripe, which allow you to accept online payments.\n\nOverall, the cost of building a website with WordPress and WooCommerce depends on the specific features and functionality you need for your restaurant website.

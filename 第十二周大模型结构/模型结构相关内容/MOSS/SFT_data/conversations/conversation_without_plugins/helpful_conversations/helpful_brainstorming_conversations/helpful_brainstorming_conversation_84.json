This shows that you are interested in what the other person has to say.\n\n6. Avoid interrupting: It's important to let the other person finish speaking before responding.\n\n7.

            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: Sure! Here's an example of using empathy in a communication situation:\n\nLet's say that a colleague has just lost a family member and is feeling overwhelmed with grief. You want to communicate your condolences and offer your support. You could say something like:\n\n\"I'm so sorry to hear about your loss. Losing someone you love is never easy. Please know that I'm here for you if you need anything or if you just need someone to talk to. Take all the time you need to grieve and take care of yourself.\"\n\nIn this example, you're acknowledging your colleague's feelings of grief and loss, and you're offering your support and empathy. You're not trying to \"fix\" the situation or offer unsolicited advice. Instead, you're simply letting your colleague know that you care and that you're there to support them in whatever way they need.<eom>\n"

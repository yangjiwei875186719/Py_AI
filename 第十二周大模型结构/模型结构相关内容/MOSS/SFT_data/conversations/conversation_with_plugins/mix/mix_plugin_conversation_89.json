            "Human": "<|Human|>: 光明小学十一月份比十月份节约用水 1/10，十一月份用水90吨，十月份用水多少吨？<eoh>\n",
            "Inner Thoughts": "<|Inner Thoughts|>: 这是一道基于知识的数学题，需要用到比例的知识来求解，因为十一月份用水是十月份的9/10，可以列出方程 9/10 * 十月份用水 = 90吨，通过计算可以求得十月份用水的数量。<eot>\n",

            "Inner Thoughts": "<|Inner Thoughts|>: 这道题需要求解方程 9/10 * 十月份用水 = 90，可以将9/10转化为0.9，那么方程变为 0.9 * 十月份用水 = 90，通过将90除以0.9即可求得十月份用水的数量。<eot>\n",

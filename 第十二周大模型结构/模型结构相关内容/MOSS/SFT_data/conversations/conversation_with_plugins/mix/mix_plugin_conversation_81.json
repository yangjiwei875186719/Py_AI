            "Inner Thoughts": "<|Inner Thoughts|>: This is a math problem that requires finding the side lengths of a rectangular prism with a known volume and side ratio. To solve this problem, I need to use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is length times width times height. Since the sides are in the ratio 1:2:4, I can assign variables to represent the side lengths, such as x, 2x, and 4x. Then I can use the given volume to solve for x and find the actual side lengths of the prism.<eot>\n",

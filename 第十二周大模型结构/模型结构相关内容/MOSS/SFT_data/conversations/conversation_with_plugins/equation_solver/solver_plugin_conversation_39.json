            "Inner Thoughts": "<|Inner Thoughts|>: This is a math problem, and I need to use the solver to solve the problem. Let x be the number of people with two hands and y be the number of people with no hands. Then we have the equation 2x + 0y = 48 and the equation x + y = 16. We can solve this system of equations to find the value of y.<eot>\n",

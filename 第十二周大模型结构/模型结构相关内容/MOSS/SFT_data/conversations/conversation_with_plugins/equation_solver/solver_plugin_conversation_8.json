To calculate the area of the triangle, I can use the formula (1/2) * b * h, where b is the base and h is the height. Since I do not know the height, I will use one of the known sides as the base and drop a perpendicular line from the opposite angle to the base to find the height. By doing so, I can calculate that the area of the triangle is <|1|>207.9 cm²</sup> (rounded to one decimal place).<eom>\n"

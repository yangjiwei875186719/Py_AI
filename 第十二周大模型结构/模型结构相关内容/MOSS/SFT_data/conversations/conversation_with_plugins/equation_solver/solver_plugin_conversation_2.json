Let x be the total number of pages in the book, and y be the number of pages that Xiao Ming has not read yet.

            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: According to the given information, we can set up two equations based on the number of pages that Xiao Ming has read and has not read yet. Let x be the total number of pages in the book, and y be the number of pages that Xiao Ming has not read yet. Then we have y = (5/4)*(x-y) and y-40 = (1/10)*(x-y+40). \n\nBased on these equations, we can solve for the total number of pages in the book x. The result is x = 86.0869565217391. Therefore, there are approximately 86 pages in the book.<eom>\n"

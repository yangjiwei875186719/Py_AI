            "Inner Thoughts": "<|Inner Thoughts|>: To solve this problem, I need to use the formula distance = rate x time. Since the two cars started racing from the same point, their distances can be calculated by multiplying their rates by time. The rate of car A can be calculated by dividing the distance it traveled by its time, and the same goes for car B. After that, I can subtract the distance traveled by car A from the distance traveled by car B to get the distance between them after 15 minutes.<eot>\n",

            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: To calculate the distance between the two cars after 15 minutes, I can use the formula distance = rate x time. Since car A finished the race in 15 minutes, its rate can be calculated by dividing the distance it traveled by its time, which is 15 minutes. Similarly, the distance traveled by car B can be calculated by multiplying its rate and time, which is 20 minutes. Using these values, I can calculate the distance between them by subtracting the distance traveled by car A from the distance traveled by car B. Therefore, after 15 minutes, the two cars were `5/4` times the distance between them at the start of the race apart from each other. <sup><|1|></sup><eom>\n"

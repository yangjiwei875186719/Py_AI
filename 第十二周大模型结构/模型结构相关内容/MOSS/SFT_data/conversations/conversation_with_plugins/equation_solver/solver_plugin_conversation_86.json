            "Inner Thoughts": "<|Inner Thoughts|>: This is a math problem that requires solving an equation. We can represent the three-digit integer as ABC, where A, B, and C are the hundreds, tens, and units digits, respectively. The equation is then 100A + 10B + C = 2(A + B + C), which simplifies to 98A = 8B + 98C. We can further simplify this to 49A = 4B + 49C. We need to find values of A, B, and C that satisfy this equation.<eot>\n",

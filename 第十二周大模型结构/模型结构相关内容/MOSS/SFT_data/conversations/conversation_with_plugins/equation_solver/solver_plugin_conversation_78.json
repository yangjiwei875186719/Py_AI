            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: To solve the problem, we can begin by using the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length multiplied by width. Let L be the length and W be the width of the rectangle. Then we have:\nL * W = 180\nWe also know that the length to width ratio is 3:4, which means that L/W = 3/4. Solving for L in terms of W, we have:\nL = (3/4)W\nSubstituting this expression for L into the equation for the area, we get:\n(3/4)W * W = 180\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n3W^2/4 = 180\nMultiplying both sides by 4/3, we get:\nW^2 = 240\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\nW = sqrt(240) = 4sqrt(15)\nSubstituting this value for W into the expression for L, we get:\nL = (3/4) * 4sqrt(15) = 3sqrt(15)\nTherefore, the length and width of the rectangle are L = 3sqrt(15) cm and W = 4sqrt(15) cm, respectively. To find the perimeter of the rectangle, we can use the formula P = 2L + 2W, where P is the perimeter. Substituting the values we found for L and W, we get:\nP = 2(3sqrt(15)) + 2(4sqrt(15)) = 6sqrt(15) + 8sqrt(15) = 14sqrt(15)\nTherefore, the perimeter of the rectangle is 14sqrt(15) cm.<eom>\n"

            "Inner Thoughts": "<|Inner Thoughts|>: This is a math problem, and I need to use the solver to solve the equation to get the accurate result. Let t be the time B needs to reach D, then A needs 2t and C needs 6t to reach D. We know that the distance each person travels is the same, so we can set up an equation: 2t + 6t + t = 1, which means the sum of their speeds is equal to the distance divided by the time, and the distance is assumed to be 1. Solving this equation, we get t = 1/9.<eot>\n",

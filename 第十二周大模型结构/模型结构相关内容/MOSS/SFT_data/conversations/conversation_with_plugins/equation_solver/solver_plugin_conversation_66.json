If the number in the tens place and the number in the ones place are exchanged, the new two-digit number obtained is 45% of the original two-digit number. What is the two-digit number?<eoh>\n",

Let's assume the number in the ones place is x and the number in the tens place is y. From the first sentence, we know that y = 2x - 3. From the second sentence, we know that 10x + y = 0.45(10y + x). We can use substitution to solve for x and y.<eot>\n",

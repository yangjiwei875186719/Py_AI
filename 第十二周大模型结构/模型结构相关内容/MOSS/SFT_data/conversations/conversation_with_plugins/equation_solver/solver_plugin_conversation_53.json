            "Human": "<|Human|>: The sides of a triangle are in the ratio of 1︰2︰3 and its perimeter is 30 meters. Find the lengths of all three sides.<eoh>\n",
            "Inner Thoughts": "<|Inner Thoughts|>: This is a math problem. Let's denote the lengths of the sides as x, 2x, and 3x, since they are in the ratio of 1:2:3. The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of these lengths, which is 6x. We know that the perimeter is 30 meters, so we can set up the equation 6x = 30 and solve for x. Once we find x, we can find the lengths of all three sides.<eot>\n",

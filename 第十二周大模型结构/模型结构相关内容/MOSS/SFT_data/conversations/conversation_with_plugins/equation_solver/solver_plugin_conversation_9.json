The triple room is 25 yuan per person per day, and the double room is 35 yuan per person per day. If a tourist group of 50 people came to the hotel and rented several rooms, how many rooms need to be rented for each type if the total cost is 1510 yuan per day?<eoh>\n",
            "Inner Thoughts": "<|Inner Thoughts|>: This is a math problem, I need to use algebra to solve the equations and find the number of rooms for each type. Let x and y be the number of triple and double rooms respectively. Then we have the following system of equations:\n```\n25x + 35y = 1510 (total cost per day)\nx + y = 50 (total number of people)\n```\nWe can solve this system of equations to find x and y.<eot>\n",

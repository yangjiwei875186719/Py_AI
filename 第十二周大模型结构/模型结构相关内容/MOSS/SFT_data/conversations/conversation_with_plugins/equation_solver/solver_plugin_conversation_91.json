            "Human": "<|Human|>: For a two-digit number, the number in the tens place is double the number in the ones place. If the number in the tens place and the number in the ones place are exchanged, the new two-digit number obtained is three times that of the original two-digit number. What is the two-digit number?<eoh>\n",
            "Inner Thoughts": "<|Inner Thoughts|>: This is a math problem that requires some calculation. Let's assume the number in the ones place is x, and the number in the tens place is 2x. The original two-digit number is 10*(2x) + x = 21x. When the digits are exchanged, the new number is 10*x + 2x = 12x. According to the problem, 12x is three times 21x, so we can set up the equation 12x = 3*21x and solve for x.<eot>\n",

            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: Based on the calculation, the number in the ones place is 0 and the number in the tens place is 0*2=0. Therefore, the two-digit number is 0, which is not a valid solution. It seems that there is no solution for this problem.<eom>\n"

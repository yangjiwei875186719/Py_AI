            "Human": "<|Human|>: A number consists of two digits, when multiplied together, the result is equal to 27 times the sum of these two digits. What’s the number?<eoh>\n",
            "Inner Thoughts": "<|Inner Thoughts|>: This is a math problem that requires algebraic equations to be solved. Let's assume the tens digit is x and the units digit is y. Then we have the equation 10x+y = 27(x+y). We can simplify this equation to get x = 3y. Substituting this value of x in the first equation we get 10(3y)+y = 27(3y+y). Solving this equation will give us the value of y and the corresponding value of x.<eot>\n",

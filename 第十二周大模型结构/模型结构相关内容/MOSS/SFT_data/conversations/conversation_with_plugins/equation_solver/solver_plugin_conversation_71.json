Then, I can create two equations based on the given information:\n- x/2 = (24-5)/(3+2)  (the ratio of Xiao Li's friend's coins to Xiao Li's after giving away 5 coins is 2:3)\n- x = (24-5)+(x/2)  (the total number of coins is the sum of the coins Xiao Li has after giving away 5 coins and the coins her friend originally had)\nThen I can solve the system of equations to find the value of x, which represents the number of coins Xiao Li’s friend originally had.<eot>\n",

Therefore, Xiao Li’s friend originally had 33 coins.<eom>\n"

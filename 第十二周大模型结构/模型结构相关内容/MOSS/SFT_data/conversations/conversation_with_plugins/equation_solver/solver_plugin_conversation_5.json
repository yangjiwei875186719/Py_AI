            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: Using algebra, we can solve for the width and length of the rectangle. Let x be the multiplier for the ratio, so the width is 5x and the length is 4x. The area of the rectangle is given as 400 cm², so 5x * 4x = 400. Solving for x, we get x = 4. Therefore, the width is 5x = 20 cm and the length is 4x = 16 cm. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2 * (length + width), so the perimeter of this rectangle is 2 * (16 cm + 20 cm) = 72 cm.<eom>\n"

Let A, O, and P represent the number of apples, oranges, and pears in each container respectively. We can set up a system of equations based on the given ratios and total number of fruits: \n\n3x + 4x + 6x = 360 (total number of fruits)\n3y = 6x (ratio of apples to oranges)\n6z = 5x (ratio of apples to pears)\n\nWe can solve the system of equations to find the value of x, which will give us the number of apples.<eot>\n",

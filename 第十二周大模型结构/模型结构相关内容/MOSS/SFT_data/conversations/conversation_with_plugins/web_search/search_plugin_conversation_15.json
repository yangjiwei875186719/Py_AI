Many companies have implemented human rights due diligence measures to identify and address potential risks to workers' rights in their supply chains. Governments and international organizations have also taken steps to promote the protection of workers' rights through policies and regulations. For example, the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights provide a framework for businesses to respect human rights, including workers' rights, in their operations and supply chains. Additionally, worker and employer organizations have been working together to develop and implement policies on business and human rights. Despite these efforts, there is still much work to be done to ensure that workers' rights are protected in global supply chains.<eom>\n"

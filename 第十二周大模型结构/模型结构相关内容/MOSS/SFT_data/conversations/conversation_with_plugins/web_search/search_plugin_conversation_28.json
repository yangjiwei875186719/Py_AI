They are using a technique called \"imitation learning\" where their algorithms learn from the decisions and movements of millions of actual drivers. This allows their autonomous vehicles to learn human-like driving behavior and improve its driving capabilities over time. Additionally, Tesla has been continually releasing software updates to address issues and improve its autopilot system. <sup><|1|></sup><sup><|3|></sup><eom>\n"

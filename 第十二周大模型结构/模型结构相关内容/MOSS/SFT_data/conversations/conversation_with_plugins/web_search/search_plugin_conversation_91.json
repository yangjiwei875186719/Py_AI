            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: Safety is one of the biggest concerns when it comes to autonomous vehicles. One of the main challenges that self-driving cars face is the possibility of both computer and physical defects. This means that the technology itself could be faulty, or there could be a malfunction in the physical components of the vehicle. Furthermore, autonomous vehicles may struggle to operate in hazardous weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, or snow, which could impair their sensors and lead to safety issues.<sup><|1|></sup><eom>\n"

Many vehicles on the road today already have driver assistance technologies that help to save lives and prevent injuries. In addition, the continuing evolution of automotive technology, including driver assistance technologies, will likely lead to further safety improvements. Furthermore, there are research studies being conducted in areas such as cyber-security, optimal merging into high-speed lanes, and estimating the trip generation impacts of autonomous vehicles on car travel.

            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: A common example of a driver assistance technology that is currently available is blind spot warning. This technology warns drivers when a vehicle is in their blind spot, helping to prevent accidents caused by lane changes. Other common driver assistance technologies include automatic emergency braking, pedestrian automatic emergency braking, rear automatic braking, and blind spot intervention. Automatic emergency braking applies brakes automatically when a forward collision is imminent, while pedestrian automatic emergency braking and rear automatic braking work similarly to prevent accidents involving pedestrians and objects behind the vehicle. Blind spot intervention takes blind spot warning a step further by actively steering the vehicle back into its lane if the driver attempts to change lanes while a vehicle is in their blind spot.<sup><|1|></sup><eom>\n"

            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: The missing side of the rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which gives us a length of 8 cm for side AD. Using the formula for the area of a triangle (area = 1/2 * base * height), we can calculate the area of triangle ADC as 4 cm * 13.8564 cm / 2 = 27.7128 cm<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, the area of triangle ADC is approximately 27.7128 square centimeters.<eom>\n"

            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: Yes, I can find the perimeter of the rectangle. We know that two adjacent sides of the rectangle are 4 cm and 6 cm. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the other two sides as sqrt(10^2 - 4^2 - 6^2) cm = 8 cm. Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangle is 4 cm + 6 cm + 8 cm + 8 cm = 26 cm. So, the perimeter of the rectangle is 26 centimeters.<eom>\n"

            "MOSS": "<|MOSS|>: Sure, I can show you the steps to solve the problem. \n\nFirst, we need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). \n\nThere are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, so we move on to multiplication and division. We have 7 * 4, which equals 28, and 16 / 4, which equals 4.0. \n\nNow we substitute these values into the original problem: 4 + 7 * 4 - 16 / 4 becomes 4 + 28 - 4. \n\nFinally, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right to get the answer, which is 28.0.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.<eom>\n"

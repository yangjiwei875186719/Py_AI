To calculate the income of the company in 2019, we can use the formula:\n\nIncome in 2019 = Income in 2020 / (1 + Growth Rate)\n\nPlugging in the values we have, we get:\n\nIncome in 2019 = 600 million yuan / (1 + 0.3)\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nIncome in 2019 = 600 million yuan / 1.3\n\nIncome in 2019 = 461.54 million yuan (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nTherefore, the income of the company in 2019 was approximately 461.54 million yuan.<sup><|1|></sup><eom>\n"

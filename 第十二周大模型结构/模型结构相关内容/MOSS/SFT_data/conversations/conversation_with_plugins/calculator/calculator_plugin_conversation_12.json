The formula for the area of a regular hexagon is (3*sqrt(3)*a^2)/2, where a is the length of the side of the hexagon. Since the perimeter is given, we can calculate the length of one side, and then calculate the area.<eot>\n",

Using the formula for the area of a regular hexagon (3*sqrt(3)*a^2)/2, we can calculate the area of the hexagon. Plugging in the length of one side, we get the area to be approximately 259.81 square centimeters<sup><|2|></sup>. Therefore, the area of the regular hexagon is approximately 259.81 square centimeters.<eom>\n"
